<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Last Emperor</h3>
<p>A classical Chinese movie, described the life of the last emperor of China, Aisin Gioro Puyi.</p>

<h3>The Legend of 1900</h3>
<p>I like the ending, feeling regreted when I think of it every time. </p>

<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>It described a warm story about the death, I love this movie because they made death and ghosts into a thing that is no longer scary, the end of life is not the death but oblivion.</h4></p>
